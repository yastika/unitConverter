# The Unit Converter Project ( Scrimba )

This was one of the project I had worked on while learning Javascript from the scrimba.

## Supporting Scrimba

Since 2017, we have created over 20 free courses on Scrimba, and we're going to
continue launching free courses. But to pay our bills, we have to charge once
in a while. So if you've ever wanted to "give back" to Scrimba, you can do that by buying
	one of our paid courses

- [Become a professional React developer](https://scrimba.com/course/greact)
- [The Responsive Web Design Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gresponsive)
- [The Ultimate JavaScript Bootcamp](https://scrimba.com/course/gjavascript)

	It would also mean the world to us if you share the courses.  

Happy Coding!

Shortcomings of the original version
	
- The first version of it used absolute unit of measurement for each element on the page. Once the page was created, the unit converter was not looking like it was expected to look.
- The logic for the unit conversion was working fine but the way the value was being provided for the conversion was not leading to a nice user experience. 
- After providing the number for conversion, the user was expected to hit enter to convert the number in different units.
- User was allowed to provide any value to the input. Even alphabets and special characters.
- On hitting backspace or delete the input would remain empty.
- The input tag did not have the accessiblity label.
-Title, Doctype, Charset meta and lang value was missing in the index.html
